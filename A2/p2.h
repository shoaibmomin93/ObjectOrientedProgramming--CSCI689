Purpose: This program calculates the value of pi using random number generation.
         Monte Carlo Simulation
         This header file has declaration of constants that are used in the main source file.

extern const int LOW;   //Declaring constants as specified in the problem statememnt. These are declared in a separate file and hence extern is used indicating that they are declared externally.
extern const int HIGH; // low represents the lower limit of the range of  random numbers and high represents the upper limit of the range of random numbers
extern const long N;   // N represents the number of iterations for which the random variables be generated.
